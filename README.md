- I work alone but I don't work with "nonamecrackers2"

- Recipe tutorial in images

- Recipe tutorial download: in "Release Tab"

- Everyone just follow the number of explosive blocks in my creative inventory tab (except the explosive blocks that already have recipes) and then discard them all (except the 4 hard blocks that must use diamond pickaxe and the 2 hardest blocks in minecraft that must be used formidibomb) into the TNT Smithing Table (1.19.4 V2, 1.19.2 V3, 1.18.2 V2)

- I delete TNT Smithing Table and Command Block Smithing Table
